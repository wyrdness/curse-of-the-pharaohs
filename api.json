      "full": "The Curse of the Pharaohs refers to an alleged supernatural curse believed to afflict anyone who disturbs the tomb or mummy of an ancient Egyptian pharaoh or high-ranking individual. The legend gained worldwide prominence following the opening of Tutankhamun's tomb in 1922, when several individuals connected to the excavation died under seemingly mysterious circumstances. While most Egyptologists and scientists dismiss the curse as coincidence, media sensationalism, and natural explanations, the legend has persisted for over a century, becoming one of the most famous alleged curses in popular culture."
